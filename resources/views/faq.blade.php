				<a href="#demo0002" class="faq" data-toggle="collapse">What does your company do?</a>
        <div id="demo0002" class="collapse">The main activity of Primeservice.com is earning money on cryptocurrency trading.

        <a href="#demo001" class="faq" data-toggle="collapse">What are the benefits of using Bitcoin?</a>
        <div id="demo001" class="collapse">Contemporary technology development raises the popularity of using electronic currency. Bitcoins have four useful qualities: they are hard to earn, decentralized from any government control, easy to transfer, and they are secured by the blockchain. Bitcoin is a faster and cheaper way of settlements in comparison with credit cards. Payments made with Bitcoins are the final ones and the risk of fraud is nearly non-existent. As Fred Wilson put it, I compare [Bitcoin] to the Internet. The Internet was a new way to transmit data. Bitcoin's a new way to transmit money. </div>
        <a href="#demo01" class="faq" data-toggle="collapse">What is Cryptocurrency mining?</a>
        <div id="demo01" class="collapse">Cryptocurrency mining is a process by which new coins are introduced into the existing circulating supply, as well as a process used to secure the network the coin operates on. The people who mine a coin, are known as miners. Instead of having a central authority that controls and secures the money supply, this control and security is spread out across the network that miners help to maintain.</div>
        <a href="#demo011" class="faq" data-toggle="collapse">What is a Blockchain Technology</a>
        <div id="demo011" class="collapse">Blockchain technology is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Or, to put it another way, blockchain is a digital ledger in which transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly. By allowing digital information to be distributed but not copied, blockchain technology created the backbone of a new type of internet. Originally devised for the digital currency Bitcoin, the tech community is now finding other potential uses for the technology.</div>

        <div id="demo012" class="collapse">All transactions are confirmed by the bitcoin system. 
					For a deal to be valid, a certain amount of time is required, usually from 3 to 6 confirmations by the system itself. This is the automatic process of the bitcoin system. A confirmation means that there is a consensus on the network that the bitcoins, for example, you received haven't been sent to anyone else and are considered your property.</div>
